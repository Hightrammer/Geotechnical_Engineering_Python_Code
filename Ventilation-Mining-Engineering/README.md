**Ventilation Engineering Python Code for the Mining Engineering Industry**

The purpose of this repository is to collect python code developed by Joaquin Roibal during his Master's degree for use by Ventilation Engineers in the Mining Industry. Primary Implementation is using a Raspberry Pi Sensehat to collect and analyze ventilation data.

Short Description of files contained in this github repository:

"Meas_Test.csv" is formatted data recorded with raspberry pi sensehat for 4 days in a laboratory setting

"Raspberry_Pi_data_display.py" will create a chart of variables collected with a sensehat, example is using Meas_Test.csv to visualize data

"Table63_AltimeterLeapfrogging.csv" contains data which is used as an example program to evaluate the vent_python_toolbox program code

"VentSurveyProgram.py" is currently an outline for a OOP version of vent_python_toolbox

"Ventilation_Mining_Python_Toolbox.py" is a collection of functions useful for a ventilation engineer to calculate air properties in a mining environment.

"sense_hat_specific_weight_data_collection.py" will record and collect data which can then be displayed with "Raspberry_Pi_Data_Display.py" python code
