# Ventilation Engineering Python Code for the Mining Engineering Industry

The purpose of this repository is to collect python code developed by Joaquin Roibal during his Master's degree for use by Ventilation Engineers in the Mining Industry. Primary Implementation is using a Raspberry Pi Sensehat to collect and analyze ventilation data.

**Short Description of Python files contained in this github repository**:

"Meas_Test.csv" is formatted data recorded with raspberry pi sensehat for 4 days in a laboratory setting, "Meas_Test2.csv" is a similarly formatted collection of data from 10/15/2016-10/20/2016 in Socorro, NM

"Raspberry_Pi_data_display.py" will create a chart of variables collected with a sensehat, example is using Meas_Test.csv to visualize data, Includes Raspberry_Pi_data_Display2 & 3, which graph the data from Meas_Test2 and Meas_Test1, and 2 together.

"Table63_AltimeterLeapfrogging.csv" contains data which is used as an example program to evaluate the vent_python_toolbox program code

"VentSurveyProgram.py" is currently an outline for a OOP version of vent_python_toolbox, currently non-functional. Plans are in motion to format Ventilation Python Toolbox in OOP

"Ventilation_Mining_Python_Toolbox.py" is the main engine behind many of the programs listed on this page. This script can be imported as a module and is a collection of functions useful for a ventilation engineer to calculate air properties in a mining environment and used in further python programs for ventilation engineers to develop their own tests/data collection. 

"senseHAT_Data_Collection.py" will record and collect data which can then be displayed with "Raspberry_Pi_Data_Display.py" python code. The interval for recording of data can be adjusted in the script. This file will accept a unique ID for data collection and records values (temperature, humidity, pressure, time) into a CSV file which can then be analyzed using Vent Toolbox tools or Microsoft Excel format.
